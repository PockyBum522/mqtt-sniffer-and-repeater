# mqtt-sniffer-and-repeater

WARNING: This is a very quick and very, very dirty demo for a project. I would suggest using this for reference only and not using it in its current state.

Working:
  * Reading different topics per display textbox
  * Repeating from one topic in to sending payload back out on another topic
  * Clear all
  * Pausing real-time updates for all textboxes except application status log

Not working:
  * Sending data manually from bottom textboxes
  * Running for long periods. I'm just appending to bound strings, it gets slow real quick.
